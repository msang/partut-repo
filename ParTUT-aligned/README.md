Alignment files are formatted in a GIZA++/Moses-like fashion: each line contains a sentence
pair and alignment points are in the usual Moses format, i.e. each alignment point is
represented as a pair i-j indicating that the i-th word (zero-indexed) of the source
sentence is aligned to the j-th word of the target sentence
